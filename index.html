            <p>For me, the collision of Probability Theory and Truth has always seemed to center around the notion that the former is a precise mathematical object, and the latter is not. Whether or not it was written down by Isaac Newton, it’s the same physical thing. Whether or not you could observe the first unicorn in America and say that it was the “missing link” in Abraham Lincoln’s biography - well, you couldn’t observe much from the experience of seeing the first unicorn in America. Either Lincoln existed in our universe, or you couldn’t say where one existed.</p>
